# CTR Prediction ‚Äì End-to-End Pipeline

This repository contains an end-to-end CTR prediction pipeline. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature pruning, and model evaluation for high-class imbalance data.

## Data Access

Raw datasets (`train.parquet`, `test.parquet`) are excluded from this repository due to competition restrictions.  
See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for dataset schema, access policy, and structure.  
All scripts assume local data access via the `data/` folder or `DATA_DIR` environment variable.

## 1. EDA Summary

## 1. EDA Summary

- **Class imbalance**: Positive rate (`clicked=1`) ‚âà 1.9% ‚Üí stratified splitting & weighted metrics used
- Data inspection revealed several near‚Äëconstant or highly correlated features ‚Üí flagged for potential drop/clip
- Transformation experiments (clip, drop, flag) showed that **clipping outliers** improved PR‚ÄëAUC (+1.7%); others had minimal or negative effect
- Among features with zero gain in all folds, both permutation and SHAP confirmed **no features** qualified for removal
- Sequence-derived features were engineered (e.g., length, repetition, token position), but **yielded negligible lift** ‚Üí excluded from final model
- Cleaned datasets saved as Parquet files for reproducibility

## 2. Modeling Summary *(To be added)*

- Model: XGBoost baseline vs. feature-augmented models
- Evaluation metrics: AP, ROC-AUC, WLL (50:50), Portfolio Score
- Early results suggest importance of `history_*` but minimal gain from `seq` features

üìé Details: *Coming soon in* [`notebooks/Modeling.ipynb`](ctr-click-prediction/notebooks/Modeling.ipynb)
