# CTR Prediction ‚Äì End-to-End Pipeline

This repository contains an end-to-end CTR prediction pipeline. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature pruning, and model evaluation for high-class imbalance data.

## Data Access

Raw datasets (`train.parquet`, `test.parquet`) are excluded from this repository due to competition restrictions.  
See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for dataset schema, access policy, and structure.  
All scripts assume local data access via the `data/` folder or `DATA_DIR` environment variable.

## 1. EDA Summary

- **Class imbalance**: Positive rate (`clicked=1`) ‚âà 1.9% ‚Üí stratified splitting & weighted metrics used
- Data inspection revealed several near‚Äëconstant or highly correlated features ‚Üí flagged for potential drop/clip
- Transformation experiments (clip, drop, flag) showed that **clipping outliers** improved PR‚ÄëAUC (+1.7%); others had minimal or negative effect
- Among features with zero gain in all folds, both permutation and SHAP confirmed **no features** qualified for removal
- Sequence-derived features were engineered (e.g., length, repetition, token position), but **yielded negligible lift** ‚Üí excluded from final model
- Cleaned datasets saved as Parquet files for reproducibility

## 2. Modeling Summary

- **Train / Valid / Holdout split**: 3-fold CV used for all tuning and calibration.  
  ‚Üí `valid` used only for early stopping and stage gating (never for model selection).  
  ‚Üí `holdout` evaluated once at final stage.
- **Best model**: Tuned LightGBM + Isotonic Calibration  
  ‚Üí Uncalibrated model had higher AP (6.34%) but heavily overconfident (MeanPred 14.8%).  
  ‚Üí Calibrated model improved LogLoss (‚Üì0.09) and predicted closer to true click rate (MeanPred 1.35% vs actual 1.91%).
- **Calibration trade-off**: Expected WLL(50:50) increase due to lower confidence on rare positive class.  
  ‚Üí Chosen for more reliable probability estimates in high-imbalance context.
- **Protocol**: Fully leak-free. All tuning and selection used train CV only; holdout used once.
