# CTR Prediction ‚Äì End-to-End Pipeline

This repository contains an end-to-end CTR prediction pipeline. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature pruning, and model evaluation for high-class imbalance data.

## 1. EDA Summary

- **Class imbalance**: Positive rate (`clicked=1`) ‚âà 1.9% ‚Üí stratified splitting & weighted metrics
- **Missingness**: Most <0.2%, but `feat_e_3` >10% ‚Üí flagged
- **Feature pruning**: Removed low-signal, constant, or highly correlated features
- **Sequence logs**: Engineered compact token-level features; excluded after no lift on hold-out

üìé Details: [`notebooks/EDA.ipynb`](notebooks/EDA.ipynb) | [`reports/EDA.md`](reports/EDA.md)

## 2. Modeling Summary *(To be added)*

- Model: XGBoost baseline vs. feature-augmented models
- Evaluation metrics: AP, ROC-AUC, WLL (50:50), Portfolio Score
- Early results suggest importance of `history_*` but minimal gain from `seq` features

üìé Details: *Coming soon in* [`notebooks/Modeling.ipynb`](notebooks/Modeling.ipynb)
